% concept3: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

\subsection{Learning Targets}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Syntax of Object-Oriented Programming
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming
		\item Classes, Objects, Methods, and Attributes
		\item Coding a Class
		\item Magic Methods
		\item Inheritance
	\end{itemize}
	\item Build a Python Package that Analyzes Distributions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedural vs. OOP}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Object: Specific instance of a class in which attributes (and sometimes methods) change
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Characteristics (attributes)
		\item Actions (methods)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Class: generic version of an object, almost a blueprint, which specifies attributes and methods
	\item Magic methods: overwrite default python behavior
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inheritance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Imagine a Clothing parent class which provides a blueprint for any type of clothing
	\item The general class helps to create more modular code and follow DRY
	\item Inheritance helps organize code with a more general version of a class which translates to more specified children classes
	\item Inheritance can make OOP more efficient to write
	\item Updates to a parent class automatically trickle down to its children!
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OOP Example: Clothing}


\subsection{OOP Example: Distributions}


\subsection{Uploading a Package to PyPI}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Recommended to create a virtual environment (almost like a silo) to test installing packages (won't affect main Python installation)
	\item Virtual environments:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Conda: manages packages, manages environments
		\item conda create --name environmentname
		\item source activate environmentname
		\item conda install numpy
		\item Pip and Venv: Pip is a package manager, Venv is an environment manager that comes preinstalled with Python 3
		\item Recommended to create a Conda environment and install Pip simultaneously
		\begin{itemize}
			\item conda create -â€“name environmentname pip
		\end{itemize}
		\item Pip with Venv work as expected, used for generic software development projects including web development
		\begin{itemize}
			\item python -m venv venv\_name
			\item source venv\_name/bin/activate (activates virtual environment)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
